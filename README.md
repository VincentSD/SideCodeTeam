# SideCodeTeam

Welcome to the SideCodeTeam project! 
This project is designed to help you learn and practice web development skills, including Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
You will be working on different landing pages and collaborating with your teammates.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local computer and start working on your assigned landing page.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer
- A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Instructions

### Clone the Repository

   First, clone the repository to your local computer using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/VincentSD/SideCodeTeam.git
cd SideCodeTeam
```

### Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your work. Replace your-branch-name with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., [your-name]-page):
```git checkout -b your-branch-name```


### Work on Your Page
#### Task 1
- Open the project in your code editor and navigate to the `team-pages` directory. 
- Choose the landing page you are assigned to work on (e.g., landing1.html, landing2.html, or landing3.html) and start making your changes.
- Verify your landing page in the checklist [`checklist.txt`]. If you are not in the list, follow the trend and assign to yourself a landing page.

#### Task 2
- Duplicate the subfolder called `vincent` in the `team-pages` folder and rename it the duplicate to your name
- Review the `README` in your new project folder and follow the directions in it

### Add and Commit Your Changes**
After making changes, add your changes to the staging area and commit them with a descriptive message:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
```

### Push Your Branch**
```git push origin your-branch-name```

### Create a Pull Request**
Go to the GitHub repository in your web browser and create a pull request for your branch. This will allow your changes to be reviewed and merged into the main branch.
